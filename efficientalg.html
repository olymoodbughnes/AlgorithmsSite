                <h2>Merge sort</h2>
                <img class="imgex3" src="images/mergeSort.png" alt = "sorting algorithm graphic representation">
                <p>This sorting algorithm is affected by the size of the input
                    as most sorting algorithms tend to do. But, unlike other
                    sorting algorithms merge sort has a complexity
                    of O logarithm of N in big O notation, this means that
                    if the input is sized 10 the time-to-sort will be half of
                    what the algorithm would take to sort an input that is ten times the size.
                    This logic can be applied to bigger numbers and the same logic will apply.

                    Merge sorts are based on the assumption that a given list is already
                    sorted to some degree, for example,
                    when sorting a list of integers, this algorithm will look at data as pairs,
                    starting at a predetermined position such as the last and penultimate
                    positions or the first and second positions, the reason why it's not comparing,
                    for example the first and last positions is because this algorithm focuses on
                    comparing positions adjacent to each other, and,
                    data at the first position and the last position aren't adjacent to each other,
                    hence the example.

                <h2>Heap sort</h2>
                <img class="imgex3" src="images/heapSort.jpg" height="300" width="400"
                    alt="sorting algorithm graphic representation">
                <p>
                    Heapsort is another example of an efficient sorting algorithm.
                    It works by identifying the extremes of a list and placing these
                    extremes at their appropriate locations, for example,
                    the smallest integer on a list will be placed at the begining of a list,
                    whereas the largest will be placed at the end.
                    Heapsort isn't the only algorithm that approaches sorting in this manner, however,
                    it does do something that algorithms with similar approaches like selection sort,
                    don't do, for example, it uses a data structure that is designated as a data heap,
                    which in itself is a type of binary tree,
                    the way it works is that once the data has been sorted into a "heap"
                    it can then be assumed that the root node of the heap has to be the
                    largest extreme of the data input.
                    After the largest extreme has been identified and sorted,
                    the sorting algorithms begins again to sort the data into a
                    "heap" and it repeats the process again, finding the extreme each time,
                    just like the previous example, the heapsort has a complexity of O logarithm of N
                    which is a very efficient complexity and makes it prone to being
                    more relied on than other algorithms.
